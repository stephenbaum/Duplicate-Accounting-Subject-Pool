Duplicate Accounting (Subject Pool)

This is code that I have used to flag students who are in multiple sections of introductory courses at Olin Business School.
It was useful in my management of the subject pool.
It can be easily repurposed to flag duplicates of any kind in an Excel file with multiple tabs.
